### Mikael Lagerroos

I am a recently graduated M.Sc. from Hanken School of Economics, where I pursued marketing as my major. The courses I chose were focused on strategic decision-making and customer experience management. Accordingly, my core interests and expertise lie strongly in these areas.

I am very eager to put my knowledge of strategic marketing into practice. I am skilled in several languages and am accustomed to working in international environments.
